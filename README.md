# My Advent of Code Solutions

Contains my solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) exercises
written in the Go programming language. 

I'm using this as practice for learning TDD (test driven development), 
essentially by using the examples given in the exercises to write the
required tests first then the necessary functions to pass those tests
and solve the exercises.
